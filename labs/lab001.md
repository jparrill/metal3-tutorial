# Lab 1: Introduction / Deployment 

At this point we will try to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on our lab/laptop/server using this [repository](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env).

**DISCLAIMER:** This header is just for our own purpose. If you find it during the laboratory, don't worry about, **you don't need execute it!**:

```bash @mdsh
mdsh-lang-bash() { shell; }
```

## Requirements

- Bare metal preferred, as we will be creating VMs to emulate bare metal hosts.
- CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18.04 OS based
- Run as a user with passwordless sudo access
- `make` app

## Hands on lab

Let's get started going to a temporary folder and then clone the metal3-dev-env repository in order to spin up a k8s cluster

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/metal3
git clone https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env.git /tmp/metal3-dev-env
cd /tmp/metal3-dev-env
make
```

This will take some minutes to finish, and at the end of the execution you will see a some tests passing to validate that the deployment was right:

```

Number of failures : 0
```

If you see this prompt, it's done but we will see what happened more in detail and those commands will help you:

- `sudo virsh list` - List created VMs
- `sudo virsh net-dhcp-leases baremetal` - List VM networking details 
- `kubectl get baremetalhost -n metal3` - List BareMetalNodes created and defined in the API 
- List and show Nodes from Ironic view
```
export OS_TOKEN=fake-token
export OS_URL=http://localhost:6385/
openstack baremetal node list
```
- `kubectl get machines -n metal3` - List Machines created 
- `vbmc list` - (Virtual Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) backed by virtual machines) List of VMs from BMC point of view.

Then we have 3 nodes here

- Minikube, that will act as a cluster manager
- Master_0 and Worker_0 which will be the Baremetal Hosts.

# Review

What we did in this lab:

- Prepare the environment for MetalÂ³
- Deploy a K8s mini cluster over "BareMetal"
- Commands to know how looks like the Kubernetes cluster and the rest of the VMs
