# Lab 1: Introduction / Deployment 

At this point we will try to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on our lab/laptop/server using this [repository](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env).

## Requirements

- Bare metal preferred, as we will be creating VMs to emulate bare metal hosts.
- CentOS 7 or Ubuntu 18.04 OS based
- Run as a user with passwordless sudo access
