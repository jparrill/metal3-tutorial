# Lab 0: Overview

This lab is targeted towards people who don’t have any Metal³ experience.

However, a basic knowledge of Kubernetes and familiarity with the *kubectl* command line tool is assumed.

As you know, Metal³ is a solution to deploy an on-premise kubernetes cluster using baremetal nodes, but usually we don't have "Baremetal nodes" just a Laptop. These tutorials will care about deploy a Kubernetes cluster on VMs but treating them as if they were Baremetal nodes.

This is how looks like the laboratory agenda:

* Deploy and explore Kubernetes on premise using [metal3-dev-env](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-dev-env/).
* Add new workers using Baremetal Operator
* Deploy [Operator-Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manage://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager)
* Deploy a fresh new Ceph cluster using [Rook](https://rook.io/) using the previously deployed OLM.
* Play with multiples kind of storage: Block, File and also using [EmberCSI](https://ember-csi.io/) drivers.
* Deploy [Kubevirt](https://kubevirt.io/) using OLM.
* Play a little with VMs.
* Deploy [Tekton](https://cloud.google.com/tekton/) and create a pipeline.
* Review & Conclusions

**DISCLAIMER:** This header is just for our own purpose. If you find it during the laboratory, don't worry about, **you don't need execute it!**:

```bash @mdsh
mdsh-lang-bash() { shell; }
```
